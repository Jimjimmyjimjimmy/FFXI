ASE addon works like old ASE. Additionally, it stops the server from seeing when you are looking at an NPC that is unspawned. It does not stop action packets towards those NPCs, though, so clicking on them will still make it apparent that you're using ASE.

Risk with this is moderate if you use it irresponsibly, or minor if you use it responsibility.
