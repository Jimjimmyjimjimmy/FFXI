Homepoints gives you all homepoints, including homepoints in expansions that you don't have access to. You'll want to unload it after you're done using it because it messes up the RoE book dialogue.

As far as danger, don't go to places that the character should not be able to access (like Adoulin on a character without Seeker's) and avoid warping to Al Zahbi and you'll probably be fine. If you do go to Adoulin without the expansion, that character will forever be stuck at the zone line. RIP Warutaru. You died for the sake of knowledge.

Obviously if SE ever wanted to detect you warping to somewhere that you haven't been yet, they could. That said, my mule got all the homepoints a while back and hasn't been banned.
